        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
          example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
          whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
          student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
          critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
          disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
          education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities
          of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field
          studying education. There are many types of education. Formal
          education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public
          schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside
          the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured
          learning through daily experiences

          Education plays various roles in society, including in social,
          economic, and personal fields. On a social level, education makes it
          possible to establish and sustain a stable society. It helps people
          acquire the basic skills needed to interact with their environment and
          fulfill their needs and desires. In modern society, this involves a
          wide range of skills like being able to speak, read, and write as well
          as to solve problems and to perform basic arithmetic tasks. It also
          includes the ability to handle information and communications
          technology. Children are socialized into society by acquiring these
          skills. Another key part of socialization is to learn how to live in
          social groups and interact with others by coming to understand social
          and cultural norms and expectations. This requires an understanding of
          what kinds of behavior are considered appropriate in different
          contexts. This way, new members are introduced to the culture, norms,
          and values that are dominant in their society. Socialization happens
          throughout life but is of special relevance to early childhood
          education. It enables a form of social cohesion, stability, and peace
          needed for people to productively engage in their daily business.
          Education plays a key role in democracies by increasing civic
          participation in the form of voting and organizing and through its
          tendency to promote equal opportunity for all.[95]

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
          Organized institutions play a key role for various aspects of
          education. Institutions like schools, universities, teacher training
          institutions, and ministries of education make up the education
          sector. They interact both with each other and with other
          stakeholders, such as parents, local communities, and religious
          groups. Further stakeholders are NGOs, professionals in healthcare,
          law enforcement, media platforms, and political leaders. Many people
          are directly involved in the education sector. They include students,
          teachers, and school principals as well as school nurses and
          curriculum developers.[120][121] Many aspects of formal education are
          regulated by the policies of governmental institutions. They determine
          at what age children need to attend school and at what times classes
          are held as well as issues pertaining to the school environment, like
          infrastructure. Regulations also cover the exact requirements for
          teachers and how they are trained. An important aspect of education
          policy concerns the curriculum used for teaching at schools, colleges,
          and universities. A curriculum is a planned sequence of instructions
          or a program of learning that intends to guide the experience of
          learners to achieve the aims of education. The topics are usually
          selected based on their importance and depend on the type of school.
